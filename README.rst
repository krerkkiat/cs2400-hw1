CS 2400 - Hard Drive Invoice
============================
This is the re-implementation of the second homework from CS 2400 class at Ohio University.
However, instead of a pure C++ implementation, the core logic will be implemented as a Python
module, and the main program will be setting up a Python interpreter in C or C++ and use 
the core logic from the Python module.
